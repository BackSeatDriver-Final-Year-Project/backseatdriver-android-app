| **About**   | For my FYP I've developed a telematics solution - whereas the mobile phone connects to a bluetooth OBD-II scanner connected to a vehicle - using the sensors on the car and on the mobile phone we calculate certain statistics and advice to deliver to the user via an online portal.               |
